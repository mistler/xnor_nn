# XNOR_NN: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks using XNOR and Binary Primitives

This is an open source performance library for acceleration of Machine Learning
frameworks on CPU. It includes highly vectorized and parallelized
implementations of common primitives with binary operations used in
convolutional neural networks with C interface.
